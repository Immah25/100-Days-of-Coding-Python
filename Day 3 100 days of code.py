#Comperatibe operators, that is, Greater than >, Less than <, Greater than or equal >=, 
#Less than or egual to <=, equal to == and not equal to !=
#You'l find that we are using one equal sign at some point and sometimes we are using
#two equal signs and it might be confusing.
#We use one equal sign when assigning a value to a variable and two equal signs when
#we are comparing whether two values are equal.

#WHen using the if/else, it is important to check spacing or indetation
#You'll see the if and else are on the same indent while the print functions are 
#on different indents.


#Odds or even exercise
#Modulo OPeration (%) = This is a method for deviding a number by another number and get the reminder
#Example 7 % 3 output will be 1

#Nested if statemnets and elif statements

#Nested if/else statement
#The reason as to why it is called nested if is beacause it is nested inside 
#the if block

# if is used when you only have one condition eg if hungry, eat

#if....else is used When there are two out comes eg if rain, stay home else go

# if....elif....else is used when there are many posible choices eg Grading and BMI category

# Nested if is used when one condition depends on another being true eg if not raining,
#the check money
# Its indentatio is very different from the other conditions, examples in the code
#blocks above



# Logical Operators :-
# "and", "or" & "not"

# "and"
#When you conbine two different conditions using an "and" operator, the both have to 
#be true for the entire line of code to be true.
#If just one of them is true, then the overal thing evaluates to false
#We use it when all the conditions are true

#"or"
# We use "or" when we want one of the condition to be True
#If one of the conditions is true or both of them are true, then it will
#evaluate to true
#It is only when both the conditions are faulse does it become false

# "not"
#What the "not" operatror does is that it basically reverses a condition.
#if the condition is faulse then it becomes true and if it is true it becomes false

#print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
